# Image Captioning and Tagging with Google Gemini

## Overview
ImageTaggerAI is a Python application that automatically generates captions and tags for images using Google's Generative AI library where I have utilised the gemini-2.0-flash model. This tool helps in organizing and categorizing images efficiently and utilizes Streamlit for the user interface.

## Features
- Image Upload: Users can upload images in jpg, png, or jpeg formats.
- Caption Generation: The app generates captions for the uploaded image.
- Tag Extraction: Extracts hashtags related to the image.
- Error Handling: Validates user-entered API keys and displays specific error messages.
- Result Display: View the uploaded image alongside its generated caption and tags.

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/anushkasethi1710/ImageTaggerAI.git
    ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
    ```bash
    cd ImageTaggerAI
    ```
3. Install the required dependencies:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Usage

To run the Streamlit app, use the following command:
```bash
streamlit run app.py
```
Enter your Google Studio API key when prompted and upload an image for analysis.

## Why Use This App?
- Simplicity: Streamlined interface for effortless image analysis.
- Insightful Information: Obtain concise yet informative captions and tags for images.
- Versatility: Useful for content creators, marketers, and anyone seeking descriptive insights from images.

This app aims to provide a user-friendly platform harnessing the capabilities of Google Gemini, making image understanding and interpretation accessible to everyone.
